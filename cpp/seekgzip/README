* INTRODUCTION
SeekGzip provides a utility and library for random seek on gzip streams.
Because gzip streams do not support random seek, SeekGzip builds an
index file that stores necessary information for random seek. An index
file has a postfix ".idx" to the corresponding gzip file. The SeekGzip
API provides the functionality for building index files, seeking on a
gzip stream (with an index file associated), and reading partial data
from the gzip stream.

SeekGzip also provides a C++/SWIG API for reading (seekable) gzip
streams.


* HOW TO BUILD THE UTILITY
$ make


* HOW TO USE THE UTILITY

(1) Building an index for a gzip file
$ seekgzip -b <FILE>
This builds an index file for the specified gzip file ${FILE}. This
utility creates an index file ${FILE}.idx

(2) Reading the data in the specified range
$ seekgzip <FILE> [BEGIN:END]
This reads the data in the gzip file ${FILE} from the offset ${BEGIN}
to ${END}, and outputs the data to STDOUT.


* HOW TO BUILD PYTHON MODULE
$ make python
$ python setup.py --build_ext
$ python setup.py install
